I managed to get a master's degree in digital marketing while being a professional gamer, decided to follow my passion for esport and work in live production. As I lost my job because of covid, I used that time to learn web developpment, a job and now hobby that I absolutely love. I'm always motivated to learn new things, I'm a team player, and I'm also pretty competitive! ",

I then discovered Python which I grew to like a lot, then TypeScript which I first hated but quickly realised it's usefulness. Finally I wanted to give go a go and... it's a pretty incredible and powerfull language for any backend work!",

			"Since I started with PHP, laravel was my very first framework, and while I found how insane it really was, I grey tired of 'this' :D. With my discovery of Javascript, I dove head first into a world of frameworks, starting with VueJS which i really liked, then NodeJS & Express followed by NestJS or NextJS. After a little while I discovered React, React Native and ElectronJS and I realised that even though JS was not the grettest performer it allowed me to do anything! I've built mobile apps connected to Apis, desktop apps connected to live production to injected live informations with SocketIO... the possibilities were endless. I also realised how powerfull Django was and how fast it allowed a backend to be secured and deployed. I've build API, multiple backends with middleware and/or jwt, protected routes etc..",
